# Bookmarklets
Created by little_arrow. Feel free to copy, modify, and use!

Bookmarklets are bookmarks on your browser that run code every time you click on it. There are several [ways to install bookmarklets](https://www.howtogeek.com/189358/beginner-geek-how-to-use-bookmarklets-on-any-device/), but here, I suggest you copy the contents of the corresponding code file and then manually paste it into your bookmarks.

## Main Character/Relationship Filter
This bookmarklet will only show fics where the designated character or relationship is primary.



This assumes that authors tag important characters and relationships first. Fics that are not tagged appropriately may be falsely included or excluded.

### One-Time Setup
Copy the contents of [main-character-relationship-filter.js](main-character-relationship-filter.js), and then manually paste it into your bookmarks.

### How to Use
- Search for a character or relationship. Make sure this tag is displayed on the top of the page, displayed after `1-20 of X works in `.
- Click on the bookmarklet to run the code. You'll have to click on it again if you refresh the page or navigate to a different page.

# TODO list for little_arrow
- Find place to host drag-and-drop bookmarklets
- Put this on greasyfork?
