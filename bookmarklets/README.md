# Bookmarklets
Created by little_arrow. Feel free to copy, modify, and use!

Bookmarklets are bookmarks on your browser that run code every time you click on it. There are several [ways to install bookmarklets](https://www.howtogeek.com/189358/beginner-geek-how-to-use-bookmarklets-on-any-device/), but here, I suggest you copy the contents of the corresponding code file and then manually paste it into your bookmarks.

## Main Character/Relationship Filter
This bookmarklet will only show fics where the designated character or relationship is primary. 

This assumes that authors tag important characters and relationships first. Fics that are not tagged appropriately may be falsely filtered out.
